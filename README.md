# DSI_Studio
A python script and some BASH scripts for running DSI studio
The code is set up so you put in your library of ROIs that you have created.  Then there is a python dictionary which creates a string that is input into the dsistudio bash command.  The settings for the tractography are there for you to modify.  Set up your fiber tracts by modifying the tract dictionary in the same grammar as it is ther already.  Be careful of white space.  Be careful of what you tell python to do at the terminal, since it will literally do anything you tell it.

Happy Tracking!
